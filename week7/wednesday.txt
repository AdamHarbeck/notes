Feign Client
	- Declarative web client, makes it easier to make requests between services
		- similarly to SpringDataJpa, Feign client generates/implements declared methods for us
	- set up
		- import openfeign dependency into service making the request
		- @EnableFeignClients (on top of class with main method)
		- create an interface with @FeignClient(name="[service-name]")
		- list the methods with relevant mappings

Circuit Breaking
	- Providing methods for failing gracefully in case a service is unavailable
	- Circuit Breaker design pattern
		- Closed - works as intended
		- Open - service is unavailable, use a fallback
		- Half-closed - testing requests to see if a service is up
	- set up
		- import resilience4j dependency into the service making the request
		- define a fallback method/behavior
		- @CircuitBreaker annotation on top of the method making a request to another service
