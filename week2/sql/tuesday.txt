DQL
	- Data Query Language
		- "sub-sub" language/ can be considered part of DML
	- Statements used to retrieve information from tables
	- SELECT
		- main operation used for querying data
			- can use multiple clauses to filter/specify a result further
		- where
		- group by
			- allows for aggregate function
				- ie: count, sum, average...
		- having
			- like a where clause after aggregation
		- order by
		- limit
		- offset

Joins
	- way to combine rows based on some logical relationship (columns)
		- inner join/ join: returns all the records that have matching values in both tables
		- left (outer) join: returns all the record from the left table and matching records from the right table
		- right (outer) join: returns all the record from the right table and matching records from the lef table
		- full (outer) join: returns all the records whether there is a match or not from both tables
		- self join: joins a table with itself to combine data with the same table

JDBC
	- Java Database Connectivity
		- establish a connection between a java application and a database
		- maven dependency imported is vendor specific (postgresql, oracle...)
	- Important Class/Interfaces
		- DriverManager (C)
			- manages the JDBC Driver
			- retrieve connection to a database
				- .getConnection()
					- pass in url, username, password
						- hardcoded (bad practice)
						- property file (prevent credential leak by adding a file to .gitignore)
						- environment variables
		- Connection (I)
			- represents the connection to a database
			- createStatement()/prepareStatement()
			- close();
		- Statement (I)
			- represent a SQL statement
			- .executeQuery()
			- best used when no user input is required
				- vulnerable to SQL injection
		- PreparedStatement (I)
			- represents a SQL statement, has be preprocessed to prevent SQL injection
			- use methods to set fields
				- setInt, setString;
		- ResultSet(I)
			- represents the results of a query
			- next(), to iterate over the result set
			- retrieve data from it using .getmethods
	- SQL Injection
		- placing malicious code in a SQL statement
			- select from users where [input];
				- input = "1; drop table tasks"

DAO
	- DataAccessObject
		- Design pattern
			- programming best practice to address a common programming "issue"/"problem"
		- used to address decoupling of Java object persistence to a specific class
