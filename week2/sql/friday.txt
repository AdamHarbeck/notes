Set Operations (union)
	- operations used to combine queries together
		- NOTE: different from Joins (combine records together based on a condition)
	- union
		- combining select query results with no duplicates
	- union all
		- combining select query results with duplicates
			- faster than regular union
	- intersect
		- returns the common records from both queries
	- except
		- returns a dataset where the second results are removed from the first
Index
	- provides a more efficient way to retrieve records from a database
		- an index is generated by default on fields set as a primary key
		- BTree
			- leverages a binary tree
				- better for comparison operations
		- Hash
			- leverages hashing
				- better from equality operations
	- makes update/insert/delete operations longer due to updating the index

Views
	- are unmaterialized "view" of a query
		- view are not stored in the database
	- helpful to keep nested queries neat and promoting reusability
