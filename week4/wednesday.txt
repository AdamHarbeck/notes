Object states in Hibernate
	- transient
		- refers to an object not associated with the database
		- new Object();
	- persisted
		- object associated with a session and matches what is found in the database
		- use a method to persist an object/a session method on a object
	- detached
		- object persisted, represented in the database but no longer associated with a session
		- session.close()

Native Query
	- writing plain SQL, NativeQuery<T>
	- bad practice
		- tightly couples implementation with a specific SQL dialect

HQL
	- Hibernate Query Language
		- a more OO way to query data compared to SQL dialects
			- SQL vendor independent
	- Query<T>

Named Query
	- define a query in the model/entity
		- in general, used in project where the architecture is not separated by layer

Criteria API
	- Java-based way to programatically query data in a more OO way
		- DQL

Caching
	- "storing for quicker access"
	- stores the results of a query from the database to save time
		- "buffer memory" that lies between the app and the database
	- Types of caching
		- L1 - Level 1
			- session level
			- automatic and mandatory
				- if multiple updates are made onto an object within a session hibernate delays the actual update as long as possible
			- closing the session removes the caching
		- L2 - Level 2
			- session factory level
				- available within the lifetime of the application
			- optional
				- meed to leverage a 3rd party dependency for session factory level caching
					- ie: ehcache
